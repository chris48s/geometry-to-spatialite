# geometry-to-spatialite

Import geographic and spatial data from files into a SpatiaLite DB.

This project is primarily useful for browsing and publishing geographic and spatial data with [datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) and [datasette-leaflet-geojson](https://github.com/simonw/datasette-leaflet-geojson). It is inspired by [csvs-to-sqlite](https://github.com/simonw/csvs-to-sqlite) and provides a similar interface.
